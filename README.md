# The Unbroken Blade: Part 1 (Script Repo)

Papyrus source code for The Unbroken Blade: Part 1, including the relevant .esp file and Dialogue view files.

The mod's assets (including compiled versions of these scripts) can be found at www.nexusmods.com for either Skyrim LE or Skyrim SE/AE.

This is a modder's resource only, downloading these files will have no effect when running the mod.

## Notes

 - All scripts are prefixed with `_arc`. This is to distinguish them from other mods or vanilla files.
 - No scripts overwrite vanilla objects, therefore compatibility is very high. Please open an issue if you experience a mod conflict.
 - A small number of scripts do extend vanilla objects utilizing some odd & creative methods. Thus compatibility cannot be guaranteed (albiet very high). Especially if other obscure mods modify the vanilla / base scripts in unexpected ways. I have done everything possible to assure compatibility with common / popular / requested mods thus far.
 - All scripts, except for a small amount (<10), are heavily optimized, and best practices are implemented. Due to this optimization, some aspects may seem cryptic, in which case comments have been added.
 - When copying to the `DialogueViews` directory, I recommend **not** overwriting existing files when prompted.
- Only the SE/AE version of the `.esp` file is included. The Skyrim LE Creation Kit can be used to convert it to from form version `43` to `42` if needed.
